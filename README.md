# Platformer
[Platformer](#download-link), action and arcade game.


## About Platformer
It's a small game, the first game that I fully made from the begining to the end.
It could be bugged, or the volume slider refuse to act.


## Sword weapon
Watch this video to see an example of platformer gameplay with the keyboard as a sword. The PS4 controller is the natively tested gamepad, but it should work with others as well.

## Laser weapon
I also included a laser in this game. While it is not as effective on a keyboard, this weapon is best suited for a gamepad.

## Mechanics
There are several game mechanics, it's not needed to know, but you can have some questions that this should answer:

 - Chest heals you, but if you have full health, it gives you power.
 
 - The damage you deal to an enemy when you collide is equal to your damage stat plus 100. If he is still alive - you the one who gets damaged.
 
 - Dash is working only with a sword.
 
 - Game supports gamepads.
 
 - Sword slows bullets and, next hit, destroys them.
 
 - The yellow bar under the enemy health bar is attack cooldown.

## Multiplayer
Multiplayer is hard, I don't think it's good idea to continue this, but I tried to do this.
